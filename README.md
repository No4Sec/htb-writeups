# 🛡️ NoSec HTB Writeups

Welcome to my collection of Hack The Box machine writeups.  
All machines are solved legally and ethically for learning purposes only.
⚠️ Educational purpose only. No real flag/hash/password is shared.  
Writeups are based on my own progress and understanding.  
Respect HTB's rules. Support learning, not cheating.

## 📌 Structure

Each writeup is written in Hungarian and Englisg, follows this structure:

- Recon
- Initial Access
- Privilege Escalation
- Post Exploitation / Notes
- Lessons learned
